//React Register & Login Component Forms w/Validation
Create a Register component:Must have first name, last name, email, password and confirm password

Create a Login component: Must have email and password

Both components must have validation.

Style the components 

You can use any form we have gone over in class and any validation we have gone over in class.

Comments: I like the simplicity of your forms.  They're straight forward.  
I notocied that a style was used for both login and register forms which caused the login to smash horizontally. Making a differnt className for the login container would work better.
I see that you added a boolean to make the submit button toggle to simulate the form data not being correct or else.  This does toggle to true and false regardless of the data being correct or not.  Preferabtly not include that usestate, helper function and toggle on the button.
I'm glad to see that your code is very clean and readable.
